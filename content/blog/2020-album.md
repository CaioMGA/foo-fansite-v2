I hate the lockdown.

> Launch lockdowns into the Sun. Stir fry lockdowns in a wok. Toss lockdowns into active volcanoes. Pour sugar into a lockdown's gas tank. Judo throw lockdowns into a wood chipper. Report lockdowns to the IRS. Karate chop lockdowns in half. Trap lockdowns in quicksand. Prank call lockdowns... 

Lockdown stole a First of October album from existence. The worst part is this was such a unique time in History. Everybody was more or less scrambling and figuring things out on-the-fly. Witnessing Rob and Andrew dealing with all that during an album creation would be such an experience that could help people cope with all the shenanigans and uncertainties circling all of us at the time.

> What a shame. Such disgrace. What a shame.
