## Spooky Time

[Chorus]

Spooky time

It's spooky time

Spooky time

It’s spooky time

&nbsp;

[Verse 1]

If you feel like having candy

Call your buddies Rob and Andy (but never call me "Andy")

Hey Andrew!

We can take it to the streets

Cause it's time to trick or treat, Andrew!

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Spooky time

It's spooky time

Spooky time

It’s spooky time

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

If you hear the children screamin'

Don't worry, it's just a demon

It's got a tooth that's sweet

You know it's time to trick or treat!

&nbsp;

[Bridge]

Hey Andrew!

Go get your costumes, we're gonna get candy

It’s gonna be awesome

It’s November

Aw man, I gotta get a nеw watch

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Spooky time

It's spooky time

Spooky time

It’s spooky timе

In your area!

Spooky time

It's spooky time

Spooky time

It's spooky time

Spooky time

&nbsp;
