## Climb That Mountain!

[Verse 1]

Living in a city

It sounds like that kind of song

Meeting new people

I wonder if we'll get along

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

(Woah) I'm gonna climb this mountain

I'm gonna scale this cliff

(Woah) I'm gonna drink that fountain

I'm too legit to quit

(Woah) I'm gonna fly like an eagle

I'm gonna run like the wind

(Woah) I'm gonna meet new people

I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

Waking up excited

I feel like today's gonna be swell

Overcoming obstacles

I believe in myself

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

(Woah) I'm gonna climb this mountain

I'm gonna scale this cliff

(Woah) I think I'll drink that fountain

I'm too legit to quit

(Woah) I'm gonna fly like an eagle

I'm gonna run like the wind

(Woah) I'm gonna meet new people

I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win

&nbsp;

[Outro]

(Woah) I'm gonna climb that mountain

I'm gonna scale this cliff

(Woah) I'm gonna drink that fountain

I'm too legit to quit

(Woah) I'm gonna fly like an eagle

I'm gonna run like the wind

(Woah) I'm gonna meet new people

I'm gonna win
