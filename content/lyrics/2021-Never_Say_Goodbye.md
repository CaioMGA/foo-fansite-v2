## Never Say Goodbye

[Verse 1]

We got an hour left now

It's been a glorious day

We've been through thick and thin, again

Yeah, we went all the way

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

So look into my eyes

We'll never say goodbye

We're reaching past the sky

Ooh!

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

It's where the curtains falling

The Sun, it starts to set

Jump and high-five then freeze frame

I know we'll never forget

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

So look into my eyes

We'll never say goodbye

We're reaching past the sky

Ooh!

&nbsp;

[Bridge]

Ooooh, ooooh, oooooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooooh, ooooh, oooooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooooh, ooooh, oooooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooooh, ooooh, oooooh

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

So look into my eyеs

We'll never say goodbyе

We're reaching past the sky

Ooh, ooh!

So look into my eyes

We'll never say goodbye

We're reaching past the sky

Ooh! (Ooh!)

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Yeah, so look into my eyes (You looking in my eyes, Andrew?)

We'll never say goodbye (I know we're gonna do this next year)

(I'm gonna hold you to it)

We're reaching past the sky (Yes!)

Ooh! Oooh! (See ya next year, everybody!)

Woah! (Thanks for being with us on this first of October)

Ahh, ha, ahh (See you next year)

Ooh, yeah! (Thank you)
