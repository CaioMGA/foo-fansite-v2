## The 11th Song

[Verse 1]

It's the eleventh hour

It's the eleventh song

How'd we even get here?

Usually takes so long

So long

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

And it's the First of October

Oh well, it's finally over

Oh, Rob, you came to Canada

And that makes me really happy

&nbsp;

[Outro]

Makes me oh so happy!

What are we doing?

How much time do we have?

(One!)

Oh

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
