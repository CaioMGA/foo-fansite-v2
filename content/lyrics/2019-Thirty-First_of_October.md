## Thirty-First of October

[Chorus 1]

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

How you doing?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

What's up?

I've got a fine selection of everything Halloween you need

Well, that sounds cool

&nbsp;

[Verse 1]

Yeah, I got all these different masks

Do you have, uh, a black cat?

A black cat mask?

Yeah, or maybe aMike Myers? I haven't decided what I'm gonna be this year

Oh, man 'cause I've got a Mike Myers, but it's just my friend, Mike, I wasn't able to get the rights for it. Would you like it?

Oh, how about aSpider-Man?

I've got Arachnid-Man, five bucks?

Okay, you've got the off-brand ones huh?

&nbsp;

[Pre-Chorus 1

Going to the next house

Walking down the street

Bringing my Halloween costumes to my community

Ding dong

&nbsp;

[Chorus 2]

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

How you doing?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Hello

I've got a fine selection of everything Halloween you need

I am intrigued

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

Awesome, 'cause I've got a bunch of costumes

Okay

Everything you could want, what do you want? I got it

I'd like to be a turtle

I don't have that

Okay, uhm,Spider-Man?

Another Spi- Oh my god, just sold my Arachnid-Man, completely different

Okay, Hmm

I've got-

Could I just be a-

Banana?

A bush? Oh I'll be a banana!

Oh, I got a bush. Here you go. Alright

Oh, sweet, that'll be great. I love bushes!

&nbsp;

[Pre-Chorus 2]

Walking down the street to Old Man Jenkins'

Last time I went to his house he threw stuff at me

Ding dong

&nbsp;

[Chorus 3]

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

How you doing?

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]

I'm gonna cut you off right there

Oh

Uh, I don't buy things from people-

You don't?

Who just show up at my door

Yeah, I know we- we had this talk last time

It's a little awkward

I got really great stuff, I got Arachnid-Man

Yeah, you're here every year

It's really good now, I'm telling you

Greg. Gregory

Yes?

Please, do not come back to my house

Listen man, I just, I wanna be at this house, can I come in the house?

I do not celebrate Halloween, I haven't for twenty years

If you look at my costumes it's gonna be really good

The last time I celebrated Halloween-

Listen man, I- you're gonna leave with a costume even if you don't like it-

MyBatmancostumeripped in the crotch,it was so embarrassing. Get off my property

Just to- y-you sure?

&nbsp;

[Outro]

'Cause I've got a fine selection of everything Halloween you need

I don't want it

No

Get off my property, Greg, oh my goodness

Tryna make a living

Get outta here Gregory. Skiddadle
