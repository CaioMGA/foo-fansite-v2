## Can't Be Stopped

[Verse 1]

They been tryin' to mess us up, yeah

They been tryin' to get to us, yeah

And we're not gonna take it, no

And we're not gonna take it, no


&nbsp;


[Chorus]

Oh, I know we can be back on top

Can't be stopped, no

And oh, I know we can be back on top

Can't be stopped, no



&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

They been tryin' to take us out, now

They been tryin' to bring us down, man

And we're not gonna take it, no

And we're not gonna take it, no


&nbsp;

[Chorus]

And oh, I know we can be back on top

Can't be stopped, no (No! No! No! No!)

And oh, I know we can be back on top

Can't be stopped, no (No! No! No! No!)
