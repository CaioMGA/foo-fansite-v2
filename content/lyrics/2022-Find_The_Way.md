## Find The Way

[Verse 1]

We don't need a road

To show us where to go

We don't need a path

We don't have the time

Don't need to draw the line

We never had a map

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

We'll find the way

We'll find a way

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

We will find the way

It's our own path to pave

There is no flag to raise

Nothing to believe

Tomorrow is a dream

We only have today

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

And we'll find the way

We'll find a way

&nbsp;

[Bridge]

We'll find the way (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

We'll find the way (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

We'll find the way (Ooh-ooh-ooh)

We'll find the way (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

&nbsp;

[Outro]

We don't need a road

To show us where to go

Wе don't need a path

We don't have the timе

Don't need to draw the line

We never had a map

We will find the way (We'll find a way)

It's our own path to pave (We'll find a way)

There is no flag to raise

Nothing to believe (We'll find a way)

Tomorrow is a dream

We only have today (We'll find a way)
