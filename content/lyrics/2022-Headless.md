## Headless

[Verse 1]

I'm stumbling around the woods

I never need to wear a hood

I can't ride a bike, I don't have a Porsche

'Cause the headless horseman has a headless horse

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Headless!

I'm headless!

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

I'm flailing all around over here

Ichabod has nothing to fear

When it comes to bridges, when it comes to ridges

I just stay off

'Cause when the headless horseman has a headless horse, it's just chaos!

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Headless!

I'm headlеss!

&nbsp;

[Outro]

Our dentist doesn't make much monеy!
