## Love to Say I Love You

[Verse 1]

Before I knew you, the sky was grey

But the clouds above me parted when I saw your face

You’ll never know, dear, how much you mean

Every day is like the sweetest dream

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

And I love to say I love you

And I love to know you’re there

And I love to hear it from you

You know I love you

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

I’ll always be there if you call

The sound of your voice will reach me above all

And when the sun sets and you’re off to sleep

When you put your arms around mе, I have all I need

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

And I love to say I love you

And I lovе to know you’re there

And I love to hear it from you

You know I love you

&nbsp;
