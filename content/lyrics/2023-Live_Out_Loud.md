## Live Out Loud

[Verse 1]

I don’t have a lot of patience

I’ve stopped trying so hard to make it work

And if I’m not mistaken

All I need is to embrace the flow, oh

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Trying to escape the crowd

No one is showing me how

I’m gonna live out loud

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

I can’t bring myself to say it

I was trying so hard to make it work

And if I am not mistaken

All I need to do is take it slow, oh

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Trying to escape the crowd

No one is showing me how

I’m gonna live out loud, hey

Trying to escape the crowd

No one is showing me how

I’m gonna live out loud

Trying to escape the crowd

No one is showing me how

I’m gonna live out loud

&nbsp;
