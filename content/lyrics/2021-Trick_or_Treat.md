## Trick or Treat

[Verse 1]

I've got a special bag of candy for you kids

I've got a special bag of candy here!

It's full of all kinds of handy dandy thingamajigs

And it's free, once a year

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

I got a special bag of candy for you kids

Come get a caramel apple or a fig

A gerbil I named Tommy, a phone charger for your mommy

Some pastrami and salami and a wig, à la mode

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Won't someone please Trick-or-Treat at my house

It's Halloween, Halloween!

&nbsp;

[Verse 3]

I've got a special bag of candy for you kids

I've got a special bag of candy here!

It's full of all kind of handy dandy thingamajigs

And it's safe, have no fear

&nbsp;

[Verse 4]

I've got a special bag of candy for you kids

Come get a discount coupon on some pogs

You don't need to forage I got oranges and porridge

A rеfinance for your mortgage and a dog, à la mode

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Won't somеone please Trick-or-Treat

It's Halloween, Halloween!

(Haha, yeah)

&nbsp;

[Outro]

I've got a special bag of candy here!
