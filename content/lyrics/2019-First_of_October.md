## First of October

[Verse 1]

I hold my breath, I count the days

I know I'll see you when I'm older

I try to fill the empty space

As that faithful day grows closer

&nbsp;

[Pre-Chorus]

And when it comes around

I wake up and kiss the ground

I was lost and now I'm found

Woah

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

It's the first of October today

It's the first of October, how many songs can we make?

We gotta get to ten by the end of the day

It's the first of October

It's the first of October today

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

Autumn leaves, Chicago breathes

Out of mind, it's getting colder

You by my side is all I need

Wish it never would be over

&nbsp;

[Pre-Chorus]

Because when it comes around

We will make a joyful sound

Raise your voices, sing it loud

Woah

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

It's the first of October today

It's the first of October, how many songs can we make?

We gotta get to ten by the end of the day

It's the first of October

It's the first of October

&nbsp;

[Bridge]

It's the first of October

Didn't think we'd get here

It took a whole damn year

And now, it's not August

It's not February

It's not July

It's not even September

I think you know what it is

&nbsp;

[Pre-Chorus]

And when it comes around

I wake up and kiss the ground

I was lost and now I'm found

Woah

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

It's the first of October today

It's the first of October, how many songs can we make?

We gotta get to ten by the end of the day

It's the first of October (First of October, first of October)

It's the first of October (First of October, first of October)

It's the first of October

It's the first of October today
