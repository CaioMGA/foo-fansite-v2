## Things to Do


[Verse 1]

I've got things to do

I've got errands to run, how 'bout you?

I've got places to be

I've gotta be somewhere at a quarter to three

Alright, what about you, Andrew?

[Chorus]

Well, got something to do now

Places to be now and things to say, hey!

(Alright, I know you're a busy guy)

[Verse 2]

Anything else, Rob?

I've got something to say!

(Oh! what could it be?)

And what I gotta say, I gotta say it today!

(Don't leave it waiting, don't leave me hanging)

(Alright, I'm gonna tell you)

And the thing that I wanna tell you is-

(Tell me! Hit me!)

Is that after this-

(What is it?)

We should totally get pizza!

(Oh yeah!)

&nbsp;

[Chorus]
Something to do now

Places to be now and things to do

(We got things to say, bro!)

(Things to say and do!)

&nbsp;

[Bridge]

Lets go! Woo!

Hey! Woo!

Uh! Woo!

Hey! Woo!

Woo! Woo!

Woo! Woo!

Woo! Woo!

Woo! Woo!

Woo! Woo!

Woo! Woo!

Woo! Woo!

Woo! Woo!

Woo! Woo! Woo, woo, woo, woo

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Something to do now

Places to be now and things to say, hey!

Something to do now

Places to be, wow! And things to say (Hey!)
