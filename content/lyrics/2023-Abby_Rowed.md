## Abby Rowed

[Verse 1]

Everyday I gotta get myself to work

Gotta choose what to use for transportation

Some people got a private jet that they can fly

Meanwhile I gotta try the train station

&nbsp;

[Pre-Chorus]

Across the universe or across town

You got a lot of ways to get around

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Jesus walked, Terry ran, Shelby drove

Rossi biked, Amelia flew, Michael dove

Abby rowed

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

Every morning it’s a crapshoot with the bus

Is it early? Is it late? You never know

Wish I had a system I could always trust

Could be great, don’t wanna wait, just wanna go

&nbsp;

[Pre-Chorus]

Across the universe or across town

You got a lot of ways to get around

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Jеsus walked, Terry ran, Shelby drovе

Rossi biked, Amelia flew, Michael dove

Abby rowed

&nbsp;

[Bridge]

(Solo!)

&nbsp;

[Scat Solo]

&nbsp;

[Pre-Chorus]

Across the universe or across town

You got a lot of ways to get around

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Jesus walked, Terry ran, Shelby drove

Rossi biked, Amelia flew, Michael dove

Jesus walked, Terry ran, Shelby drove

Rossi biked, Amelia flew, Michael dove

Abby rowed
