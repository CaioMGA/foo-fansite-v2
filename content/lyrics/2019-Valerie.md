## Valerie

[Verse 1]

Hazel eyes

Turned away, we never say goodbye

Couldn't know

Was the last time that I held you close

&nbsp;

[Pre-Chorus]

Woah, can't you see?

Woah, you've broken me

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Oh oh, Valerie

This isn't how our story had to be

Oh oh, Valerie

Thought she'd always be a part of me

Don't know if you know

I still think about you, oh

If you're ever coming home, oh, oh

I miss you so

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

It can't be

Somebody tell me this is all a dream

Left your rings

Like the life we had didn't mean a thing

&nbsp;

[Pre-Chorus]

Woah, can't you see?

Woah, you've broken me

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Oh oh, Valerie

This isn't how our story had to be

Oh oh, Valerie

Thought she'd always be a part of me

I don't know if you know

I still think about you, oh

If you're ever coming home, oh, oh

I miss you so

&nbsp;

[Outro]

I don't know if you know

I still think about you, oh

If you're ever coming home, oh, oh

I miss you so

&nbsp;
