## Don't Go

[Verse 1]

I know your reasons are not mine, that's fine

Still, I believe in this time

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Don't go too soon

Don't go, just because I do

Don't go leave the room

Don't go, 'cause I need you


&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

I know this feeling is all mine, that's fine

Can you believe in this time?


&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Don't go too soon

Don't go just because I do

Don't go leave the room

Don't go, 'cause I need you

Don't go, 'cause I need

&nbsp;
