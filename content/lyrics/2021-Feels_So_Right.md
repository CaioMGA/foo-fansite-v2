## Feels So Right

[Verse 1]

Let me tell you something 'bout my life

Lately, it ain't feeling quite so right (Yeah-eah)

I got to cross the border just last night

Where I think my future's looking bright, ha!

&nbsp;

[Chorus 1]

It's been coming, yeah!

And now I'm strumming!

And it feels so right!

Woo, alright! (Ooh-ooh-ooh) (Alright now)

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

Let me tell you something 'bout my life

(Ooh-hoo-hoo)

Got to move, we've got ten songs to write

&nbsp;

[Interlude]

Huh!

Woo!

&nbsp;

[Chorus 2]

2020 got me bumming

But now I'm drumming

And it feels so right!

Woo, alright! (Yeah!)

2020 got me drumming (It’s been coming)

And now I'm strumming, hey!

And it feels so right! (Yaw, yaw)

It's all right! (Woo-hoo!)

&nbsp;

[Outro]

(Alright Andrew, we got ten other songs, let's go!)

Alright! (Alright now, yeah!)

(Let's skip the tritone and let's get out of here!)

Let's do it! Yeah! Go! Let's go!

&nbsp;

(Yeah, I don't know)

(I mean, we didn't, uh, th-, you know—)
