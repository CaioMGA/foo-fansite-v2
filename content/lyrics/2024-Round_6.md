## Round 6

[Verse 1]

Back at it like a bad habit

A jackrabbit with a jackhammer

Jamming on a mad racket (Rrr)

It's two player

A loudmouth soothsayer

And a nu metal axe slayer with a blue saber (Pass me the controller, Andrew)

A true blader

Rollin' with the pro skaters

And we take it up to 10

But no later

Yeah, we're doing it again, and it sounds sick

Punch in, punch out, this is round 6

Woo!

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Rip it, stick it, hit it, dig it

Down and out

Kick it, flip it, pick it, whip it

Round and round (Round 6!)

Keep up, the game is not over

Keep up, the game is not over

Get down with First Of October

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

Pick up the gems, pick up the pieces (Spyro)

Pick up the pace

Take it quicker 'cause I'm running a racе

The clock is ticking on the ticker (Grеg)

Let me rig up the digger

I'll be the winner going bigger when I'm pulling the trigger

Don't press the reset

The best of the best are fresh from recess

On the SNES (I got the high score)

Round 6, yes that's the count (Got so many gems)

Got the pins, pull them out like blaow

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Rip it, stick it, hit it, dig it

Down and out

Kick it, flip it, pick it, whip it

Round and round (Round 6!)

Keep up, the game is not over

Keep up, the game is not over

Get down with First Of October
