## It's Good to be Back

[Verse 1]

It’s good to be back

Jet lag, flyin’ in

Under that Union Jack

It’s good to be back

If you start nodding off, then pick up the slack, oh

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

These brothers don’t hold back

You know that that’s a fact

It’s good to be back

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

It’s good to be friends

Double decker

Ridin’ on a high ride by Big Ben

It’s good to be friends

Ten for ten, seeing it through to the end, mmm

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

We never wonder when

This connection's heaven sent

It’s good to be friends

Hey!

&nbsp;

[Verse 1]

It’s good to be back

Jet lag, flyin’ in

Under that Union Jack

It’s good to be back

If you start nodding off, then pick up the slack

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Hey! Woah

Thеse brothers don’t hold back

You know that that’s a fact

It’s good to be back

&nbsp;
