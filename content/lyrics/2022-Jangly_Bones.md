## Jangly Bones

[Chorus]

When the moon's full

Shake your jangly bones

In the darkness

Howling with the wolves

When the moon's full

Shake your jangly bones

Let me hear "a-woo"!

&nbsp;

[Verse 1]

When the midnight bell is tolling

And you feel a chill (Ooh)

It might be a thirsty hound

Approaching for the kill (Oh god, oh god!)

There's no way to ward it off

You simply have to run (Ah)

Fearing for your life

But isn't it fun?

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

When the moon's full

Shake your jangly bones

In the darkness

Howling with the wolves

When the moon's full

Shake your jangly bones

Let me hear "a-woo"!
