Dungeon Man

Doing everything you can for Dungeon Man

Collecting all the gems that pay for functions, fam

Doing everything you can to pump the jam

Dungeon Man

Getting all the gemstones, looking at the map

Check the inventory, dodgin' all the traps

Jumping over lava, sliding down the hall

Get the magic guava, throw a fireball

Collecting all the gems that pay for functions, fam

Doing everything you can to pump the jam

Dungeon Man
