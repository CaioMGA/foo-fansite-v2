## Two Friends

[Verse 1]

I've got these two friends that I know

I met them at the last- show

And I’d like to see them, but I can't be seen with them and my friends

If they go, then I can't go

&nbsp;


[Verse 2]

I’ve got these two friends that I know

They don't really smell that great- woah, that's bad

I would love to see them, but I can't be seen with them and my friends

If they go, then I can't go


&nbsp;

[Verse 3]

I've got these two friends that I know

And I wish I could talk to them, I wish I could talk to them

I have two smelly friends that I know

And I wish I could talk to them, yeah, I wish I could talk to them

But they smell so bad, I can't be seen with them
