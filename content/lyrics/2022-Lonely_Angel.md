## Lonely Angel

[Verse 1]

And I know that if you really cared

We could have this moment anywhere

If I told you what it meant to me

Would you hear me? Would you hear me?

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Lonely angel

So entangled

Lonely angel (Ahh)

Ooh (Ahh)

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

If we waited, would it be the same?

I donâ€™t know if I can walk away

If I never said your name again

Would it matter? Does it matter?

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Lonely angel

So entangled

Lonely angel

Ooh (Ahh)
