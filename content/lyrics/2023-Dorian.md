## Dorian

[Verse 1]

Never knew how much it hurt

Never knew that it could break me

But to be across an ocean

I know it’s bittersweet

To be without you

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

Could you ever understand

What it means to say goodbye?

One last look into your grey eyes

Before grey skies take me away, mm

&nbsp;

[Refrain]

To be without you, uh

To be without you

To be without you, ohh

To be without you

&nbsp;

[Verse 3]

Never have the time we want

And I might not have the words

All I’m sure is that it’s real love

Real love, it hurts

To be without you

&nbsp;

[Refrain]

To be without you

To be without you

To be without you, ohh

To be without you
