## Day Old Milk

[Verse]

I've been feelin' a lot like Greg

I've been wonderin' if I'm okay here

I've been feelin' a lot like Greg

I've been wonderin' if I can stay here

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

'Cause I'm showin' up to houses

And I'm bringing all my day old

Day old, day old, day old, day old milk

&nbsp;

[Verse]

I've been feelin' a lot like Greg

I've been wonderin' if I'm okay here

I've been feelin' a lot like Greg

I've been wonderin' if I can stay here

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

'Cause I'm showin' up to houses

And I'm bringing all my day old

Day old, day old, day old, day old milk

&nbsp;

[Synth Solo]

Woo

Greg it up!

Woo!
