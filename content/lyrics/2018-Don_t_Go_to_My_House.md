## Don't Go to My House

[Verse 1]

If you wanna go to my house, you gotta ask me first!

You just can't go there, you just can't go there!

If you wanna hang out with me, you gotta ask me first!

You can't just show up, that's really weird!


&nbsp;


Woo!


&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

If you wanna go to my house, you gotta ask me first!

You can't just go there, you can't just go there!

If you wanna be my car insurance agent, I gotta sign a paper or something!

You can't just start representing my car insurance! Get out of my house!


&nbsp;


[Outro]

Woo!

This goes to you Greg!
