## Miracle

[Verse 1]

I waited long

And love, you came

It's like I always knew

Your name

Love, don't you cry

Don't be afraid

Promise I'll always keep

You safe


&nbsp;
[Chorus]

'Cause now you're here, and all I see

Is you're a miracle

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

I never knew

A sweeter smile

A kinder morning light

My child

I never thought

That I could feel

Something so beautiful

And real

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

And now you're here, and all I see

Is you're a miracle to me

&nbsp;
