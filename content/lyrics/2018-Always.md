## Always

[Verse 1]

I've been aching

For a lost day

I've been aching

You've been changing

You were always

You've been changing

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

It became too much

On a fall day

Everything went cold

Now I can't look to you, I can't look to you

You were always there, 'til you weren't

'Til it all changed

You were always, 'til it all changed

You were alwaysâ€”

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

I've been aching

For a new day

I've been aching

You've been taken

Taken away

You've been taken

&nbsp;
