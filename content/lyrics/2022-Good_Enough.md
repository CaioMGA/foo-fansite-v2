## Good Enough

[Verse 1]

No matter what I do

It feels like I'm stuck with you

Seems to me that I can't get through

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

(Hang on) You got me all messed up

(Hang on) Am I good enough?

(Hang on) You got me all messed up

(Hang on) Am I making the cut?

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

'Cause no matter what I do

It feels like I'm stuck with you

Seems to me that I can't get through

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

(Hang on) You got me all messed up

(Hang on) Am I good enough?

(Hang on) You got me all messed up

(Hang on) Am I making the cut?

&nbsp;

[Outro]

(Hang on)

I don't need you to tell me

All the ways that you see me

(Hang on)

I don't need you to tell me

All the ways that you see me
