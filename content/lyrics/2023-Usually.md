## Usually

[Verse 1]

Usually, this comes easy to me

But recently, I'm just feeling off

Typically, I can get it in one try or three

But lately, I'm just thinking wrong

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

Usually, this would be setting me free

But recently, I'm just feeling off

Honestly, I could use just a little bit of sleep

But it seems I go on

&nbsp;

[Outro]

But it seems I go on

&nbsp;
