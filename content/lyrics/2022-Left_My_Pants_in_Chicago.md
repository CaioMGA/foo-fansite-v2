## Left My Pants in Chicago

[Chorus]

I left my pants in Chicago

I left my shirt in Tennessee

I'm on my way back to Toronto

And all I got's my socks and boxer briefs

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

I left my pants in Chicago

I left my shirt in Tennessee

I'm on my way back to Toronto

And all I got's my socks and boxer briefs

&nbsp;

[Bridge]

'Cause if you stop, you smell the roses

You can always get a better breeze

So I leave my trousers on the roadway

Forget to put them on before I leave

(Every time)

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

I left my pants in Chicago (Chicago)

I left my shirt in Tennessee (Tennessee)

I'm on my way back to Toronto (Toronto)

So if you see my clothes, please mail them back to me (Yow!) (Back to me)

&nbsp;
