## It's Time to Move On

[Verse 1]

It's time

It's time to move on

I have too many, too many, too many, too many, too many more songs

It's time

I've got to be strong

Change what I can change, and carry on

Change what I can change

Write the many wrongs, and carry on

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

It's time

It's time to move on

I have too many, too many, too many, too many, too many more songs

It's time

I've got to be strong

Change what I can change, and carry on

Change what I can change, and carry on

&nbsp;

[Verse 3]

(Ah)

It's time

It's time to move on (Yeah) (Ahh)

I have too many, too many, too many, too many, too many more songs

(Yeah)

It's time

I've got to be strong

(Yeah) (Ahh)

Change what I can change, and carry on

(Yeah)
