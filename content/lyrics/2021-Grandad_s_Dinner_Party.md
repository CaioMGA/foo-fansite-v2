## Grandad's Dinner Party

[Verse 1]

I'm into something, I've been to school

I'm into nothing, I bend the rules

I make the sauces, I grow the beans

I count my losses, I am the scene

Huh!

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

I got something cooking, it's smelling good

You're getting nothing, understood?

I got the recipe from my dear old mom

And you'll have to pass due to your high cholesterol

Hey!

&nbsp;

[Spoken Outro]

Hehehehe…

Hoohoohoohoohoo…

Can't handle it, can ya, kid?

Should be a drive-thru around here you can go through…

Hehe!

Bring it back, I'll still be here..

Hеhuhu!

Be here 'til thе day I die!

Maybe..

I might move

Hmhm

Ooh, that's spicy!

Hehehehe!

Tell your mom to bring back those uh.. potatoes, huh..
