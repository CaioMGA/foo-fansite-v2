## Make It Through the Night

[Chorus]

Ooh

(What’s that?)

Ooh

(I heard something over there)

Ooh

Ah

&nbsp;

[Verse 1]

I keep my silver in my sight, and I

Chew garlic every single night, tastes fine

I don’t have to worry about the bite, do I?

Just need to make it through the night, alive!

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Ooh

Ooh

(Oh, it’s just my cat, Charles)

Ooh

(Charles, you really gotta stop doing that)

Ah

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

I just bought a new pontoon, brand new

But I can’t use it in the black lagoon

I stay inside whenever there’s a full moon

'Cause I just need to make it through the night, alive!

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Ooh

(Charles)

Ooh

(Just a car outside)

Ooh

Ah

&nbsp;

[Outro]

Ah, ugh

I’ve just been watching too many old horror movies

Peacock has all of the Dracula films

I should cancel my subscription

Maybе get into MLB

Get into sports

&nbsp;
