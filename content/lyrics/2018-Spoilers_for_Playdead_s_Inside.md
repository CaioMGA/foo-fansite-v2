## Spoilers for Playdead's Inside

[Verse 1]

Walkin' in the woods is what I'm all about

God, these dogs really make me frown

This red shirt is all I own

Oh, I hope I can get it home

&nbsp;

[Chorus 1]

Oh, I hope this ends well

I don't do good with disembodied bodies

Oh, I hope this ends well

And we don't get a vague ending

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

Gettin' chased underwater, what I'm all about

This creepy long-haired girl really makes me frown

Submarine all the time is what I'm all about

I hope I get home

&nbsp;

[Chorus 2]

Oh

Oh, I hope I get home

Oh, I hope this doesn't end with me in a giant blob of other humans at the beach
