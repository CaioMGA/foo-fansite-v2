## Bookmobile

[Verse 1]

She's rolling down the lakeshore

Bringing books to all the grade fours

Get the government to pay for it

Teri in the area, I'm feeling the hysteria

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

She's rolling down the lakeshore

Bringing books to all the grade fours

Get the government to pay for it

Bookmobile, we got some books on wheels

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Rob's mom!

(In your area!)

Rob's mom!

It's lit!

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

Shе's rolling down the lakeshore

Bringing books to all the grade fours

Get the government to pay for it

[Chorus]

Rob's mom!

(In your area!)

Rob's mom!

(That's my mom!)

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Rob's mom!

(In your area!)

Rob's mom!
