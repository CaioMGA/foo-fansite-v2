## Do You Want To?

[Verse 1]

Rarely, I see you

Do you feel like I do?

I want to be with you

I've felt this so long

Waiting, I can do

I wish I could call you

I want to be with you

Could I be so wrong?

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

I've been wrong

Do you want to? Do you want to?

Oh, so wrong

Do you want to? Do you want to?

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

Rarely, I see you

Do you feel like I do?

I want to be with you

I've felt this so long

Next time I see you

Will you feel like I do?

I want to be with you

Could I be so wrong?

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

I've been wrong

Do you want to? Do you want to?

Oh, so wrong

Do you want to? No, I want to

&nbsp;

[Verse 3]

Rarely, I see you

Do you feel like I do?

I want to be with you

I've felt this so long

Waiting, I can do

I wish I could call you

I want to be with you

Could I be so wrong?

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

I've been wrong

Do you want to? Do you want to?

Oh, so wrong

Do you want to? No, I want to
