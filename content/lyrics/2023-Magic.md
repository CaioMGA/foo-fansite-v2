## Magic

[Chorus]

Another day by your side

Showing you all the world’s magic (magic!)

Another day, you and I

Being with you feels so much like magic (magic!)

&nbsp;

[Verse 1]

It’s such a lovely afternoon

Taking my time being with you

Anything you’re going through

I will be there, be there for you, yeah

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Another day by your side

Showing you all the world’s magic (magic!)

Another day, you and I

Being with you feels so much like magic (magic!)

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

There’ll come a day

When you will go

Building a life out on your own

But I will see you everywhere

It’s all a reminder of what we shared, yeah

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

Another day by your side

Showing you all the world’s magic (magic!)

Another day, you and I

Being with you feels so much like magic (magic! magic!)

&nbsp;

[Outro]

It’s such a lovely afternoon
