## I Am Not Afraid

[Verse 1]

I haven't been back since the incident

Back then I was so innocent

I’m not gonna run, I'm not gonna scream

I'm gonna get coffee with sugar and cream

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

’Cause I am not afraid of the crêpes

Get the eggs in my face

Hollandaise on my plate

I'm having breakfast at this place

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

Uh, yes, a table for one

I'm going to have breakfast, I'm going to have fun

I will sit and eat here

Don't mind my protective gear!

&nbsp;

[Chorus]

I am not afraid of the crêpes

Get the eggs in my face

Hollandaise on my plate

I'm eating breakfast at this place

I'm not afraid of the crêpes

Get the eggs in my face

Hollandaise on my plate

I'm eating breakfast at this place

&nbsp;
