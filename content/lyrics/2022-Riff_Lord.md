## Riff Lord

[Verse 1]

I just bought an airplane

I'm fillin' it with fuel

I'm loadin' up my cargo

I'm the fuzz pedal mule

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

Plug into the lightning

And turn it up to 10

I know it's kinda frightning

You might never play again

&nbsp;

[Bridge]

Woo!

Yeah, I'm here for personal

Those bags are... Socks!

&nbsp;

[Verse 3]

I just crossed the border

They didn't see a thing

I burned all of their tonewood

And I clipped every string

&nbsp;

[Verse 4]

These tones are illegal

Bow before my chords

I make it sound evil

You know I'm the riff lord!

(Riff!)

(Woo!)

&nbsp;
