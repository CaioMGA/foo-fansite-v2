## Greg!

[Intro]

Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome to your block party

Coming in at five-foot-four, in the stained khaki pants and button up shirt

He's sold you your car insurance, he's your favorite house on Halloween, he's not welcome at my house without asking

Here to bust a move at the block party, your neighbor:

&nbsp;

Greg!

&nbsp;

[Verse 1]

I'm Greg

I'm Greg!

Greg! (Greg!)

I'm Greg

That's my name

I'm Greg (Greg!)

Gregging it up! (Greg!)

&nbsp;

[Bridge]

Look at me, Greg!

If you ask me my name

I will respond with Greg

'Cause uh- I- that's me

&nbsp;

[Verse 2]

(Greg!)

I'm Greg

(Yeah, man, love you, Greg!)

My name's Greg! (Greg!)

If you look at my birth certificate, that's what it's going to say (Greg!)

Gregory (Greg)

But if we're friends, you can call me Greg (Greg!)

Or if you don't know me (Oh, Greg!)

I'm Greg! (Greg!)

&nbsp;
