### About the band
Every year since 2018 (_except 2020 due to Covid restrictions_), on October 1st, **[Andrew Huang](https://www.youtube.com/@andrewhuang)** and **[Rob Scallon](https://www.youtube.com/@robscallon/")** record an album in one day. They compose, perform and record all songs from said album in a single day. To be more precise, they do all that in 12 hours.

_In 2024 they recorded in November 15th due to Covid issues as well._

### About the site
Fansite created as a hommage to **First of October**. Designed, coded and maintained by Caio Amaral.

This site does not use any JavaScript framework. The audios and videos shown in the site are streamed from Youtube due to its convenience (it's free, available worldwide, and fast). The site is self-hosted.

I updated the site in 2025 to have all the lyrics for the songs. To achieve this I chose to use HUGO, a static site generator.

I decided to create this site because this is the only band I look forward to their next album every year. Lyrics were collected on [Genius](https://genius.com/artists/First-of-october).
