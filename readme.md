# First of October Fansite v2

## About the site
Fansite created as a hommage to **First of October**. Designed, coded and maintained by Caio Amaral.

This site does not use any JavaScript framework. The audios and videos shown in the site are streamed from Youtube due to its convenience (it's free, available worldwide, and fast). The site is self-hosted.

I updated the site in 2025 to have all the lyrics for the songs. To achieve this I chose to use HUGO, a static site generator. Lyrics were collected on [Genius](https://genius.com/artists/First-of-october).

I decided to create this site because this is the only band I look forward to their next album every year.
